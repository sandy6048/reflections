- Remote repository or remotes, are the repositories that are used to sync the commit history to and from GitHub repos

- Instead of pushing individual commits, its advisble to push the whole branch so that whole commit history is transferred to GitHub repo in one shot

- "git remote" command to show the list of remote repositories

- "git remote add <remote repo name> URL" will create the remote repo. 
Eg: git remote add origin https://github.com/sandy6048/reflections.git

(This is run when you are in a particular repo, so above command links that local repo into the provided remote repo)

- "git push <remote repo name> <local branch>" - will push the local branch commit history and files into remote repo
Eg: git push origin master

- "git pull <remote repo name> <local branch>" - will pull all the remote repo commits into the local repo
Eg: git pull origin master

- "Fork" on GitHub is simlar to "clone" remote repository into local computers. Forking is to replicate a GitHub repository into a new GitHub repo
