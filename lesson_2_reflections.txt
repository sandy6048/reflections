- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This will convert the normal directory into a git repository. Once this  is done, we can find a .git hidden directory created and can be seen only when ls -a is used on that repo

- Command to add file to the git repo's staging area
git add

- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate step before commits are made to the repository from the working directory
The value this brings in is a flecibility to define what files should be part of a specic commit and what can be part of another commit in the same working directory
