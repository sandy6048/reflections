- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
This will convert the normal directory into a git repository. Once this  is done, we can find a .git hidden directory created and can be seen only when ls -a is used on that repo

- Command to add file to the git repo's "staging area"
git add

- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate step before commits are made to the repository from the working directory
The value this brings in is a flexibility to define what files should be part of a specific commit and what other files from the same working directory can be part of another commit

- How to check the delta between Working area and the Staging area
Use "git diff" (with no commit ids)

"git diff <commit1> <commit 2>" -> shows delta between these commits in the repo

"git diff" -> shows the delta betwene the files in working directory and staging area

- How to check the delta between Staging area & Repository
Use "git diff --staged"

- To revert the changes made in the working directory or satging repo and not yet in the Git Repo
Use "git reset --hard"
